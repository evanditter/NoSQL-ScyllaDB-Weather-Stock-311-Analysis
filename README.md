## NoSQL ScyllaDB Project

The main purpose of this project was to get familiar with a NoSQL storage technology. ScyllaDB is a column-family storage NoSQL technology based off Cassandra but is supposed to be up to 10x more efficient. 

The scripts and dataset outputs are currently in the repo. There was also some work done by my partner on the project who did much of the AWS work to set up our database in the cloud. For privacy reasons, that is kept out of this repo.

The scripts were used to pull, cleanse, and filter the datasets we were using. The scripts also connected to our AWS instance. There were also some helper or utility scripts. Lastly, there is a set of analysis scripts that were used to draw conclusion or try and find trends between weather, 311 requests, and stock data. 

The tech stack was ScyllaDB, AWS, Docker, bash, and python. My partner did the AWS and bash scripting where I focused on the python scripting which was working with retrieving, cleansing, and filtering the data and then doing the analysis upon it. I still was learning how AWS worked and how to interact with it to get my scripts running.
