***NoSQL ScyllaDB Project***

The main purpose of this project was to get familiar with a NoSQL storage technology. ScyllaDB is a column-family storage NoSQL technology based off Cassandra but is supposed to be up to 10x more efficient. 

The scripts and dataset outputs are currently in the repo. There was also some work done by my partner on the project who did much of the AWS work to set up our database in the cloud. For privacy reasons, that is kept out of this repo.
